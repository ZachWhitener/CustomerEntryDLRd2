## Customer Entry Challenge

A quick solution to solving a customer entry problem using a MEAN app. 

## Cloning the code and running the server

1) `$ git clone https://github.com/ZachWhitener/CustomerEntryDLRd2.git` into an empty folder

2) `$ npm install`

3) Start the MongoDB by making sure [Mongo is installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Once Mongo is
    installed, you can start the database using:

    `$ mongod`
    
    If that doesn't work, try appending `--smallfiles` to mongod.
4) Start the NodeJs server:
    
    `$ node server.js`
    
If all went well, the app should now be running on port 8080.
